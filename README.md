**View my progress here: [https://jowatson-portfolio-trove-marketplace.netlify.app](https://jowatson-portfolio-trove-marketplace.netlify.app)**

Inspired by similar platforms such as [depop](https://www.depop.com/gb/) and
[vinted](https://www.vinted.co.uk), however I am exploring options to search by
image, and suggest similar items based on image classification.

## 📝 To-do
### Back-end:

The back-end is a RESTful API built with django and PSQL. I am currently using the public api
[http://fakestoreapi.com](http://fakestoreapi.com) as placeholder data on the
front-end whilst this is being implemented.

### Front-end:

[ ] Create new user account 

[ ] View and add to basket

[ ] Validate user session (https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication)

[ ] Search bar

[ ] Loading indicator when waiting on API
