## 👷🏻‍♀️🔨 **This project is currently ongoing!**


Inspired by similar platforms such as [depop](https://www.depop.com/gb/) and
[vinted](https://www.vinted.co.uk), however I am exploring options to search by
image, and suggest similar items based on image classification.

## 📝 To-do

### Back-end:

The back-end will be a RESTful API built with django and relying on an SQL

front-end.
