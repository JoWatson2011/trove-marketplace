Inspired by similar platforms such as [depop](https://www.depop.com/gb/) and [vinted](https://www.vinted.co.uk), however I am exploring options to search by image, and suggest similar items based on image classification.

## 📝 To-do 
### Front-end:
[X] Custom hook for responsive display
[ ] Custom hook for for inputs
[ ] Create a new user account
[ ] User log in validation with [AuthO](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/)
[ ] Search bar
[ ] Loading indicator when waiting on API
[ ] View and add to basket

### Back-end:
The back-end will be a RESTful API built with django and relying on an SQL database. 
I am currently using the public api [http://fakestoreapi.com](http://fakestoreapi.com) as placeholder data on the front-end.
