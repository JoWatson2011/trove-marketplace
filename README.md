## 👷🏻‍♀️🔨 __This project is currently ongoing!__
View the WIP here: [https://jowatson-portfolio-trove-marketplace.netlify.app](https://jowatson-portfolio-trove-marketplace.netlify.app)

Inspired by similar platforms such as [depop](https://www.depop.com/gb/) and [vinted](https://www.vinted.co.uk). Users can add their own products and buy items listed by other users.

## 📝 To-do 
### Front-end:
1. View and add to basket
2. View and change user details
3. Modifications to styling so fully responsive
4. Loading indicator when waiting on API
5. Create a new user account

### Back-end:
The back-end will be a RESTful API built with django and relying on an SQL database. 
I am currently using the public api [http://fakestoreapi.com](http://fakestoreapi.com) as placeholder data on the front-end.
