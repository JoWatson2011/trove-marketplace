# trove marketplace

👷🏻‍♀️🔨 _This project is currently in progress!_

Inspired by similar platforms such as [depop](https://www.depop.com/gb/) and [vinted](https://www.vinted.co.uk). Users can add their own products and buy items listed by other users.

__Work In Progress__
Front-end:
1. View and add to basket
2. View and change user details
3. Modifications to styling so fully responsive
4. Loading indicator when waiting on API
5. Create a new user account

Back-end:
The back-end will be a RESTful API built with django and relying on an SQL database. 
I am currently using the public api [http://fakestoreapi.com](http://fakestoreapi.com) as placeholder data on the front-end.
