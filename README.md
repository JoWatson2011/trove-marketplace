Inspired by similar platforms such as [depop](https://www.depop.com/gb/) and
[vinted](https://www.vinted.co.uk), however I am exploring options to search by
image, and suggest similar items based on image classification.

## 📝 To-do

### Front-end:

[X] Custom hook for responsive display 

[ ] Refactor forms with useForm

[ ] Feature: Create a new user account 

[ ] Search bar

[ ] Loading indicator when waiting on API

[ ] View and add to basket

### Back-end:

The back-end will be a RESTful API built with django and relying on an SQL
database. I am currently using the public api
[http://fakestoreapi.com](http://fakestoreapi.com) as placeholder data on the
front-end.
